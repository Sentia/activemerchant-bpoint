# activemerchant-bpoint

ActiveMerchant Bpoint is an add-on for ActiveMerchant which provides a gateway for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's BPOINT merchant gateway.

## Installation
Before installing the gem you should have a BPOINT account ready to use. If not then [Contact the commonwealth bank of australia for more info.](http://www.bpoint.com.au/bpoint/business/contact.html)

To install simply add the following line to your `Gemfile` and then run `bundle install`:

    gem 'activemerchant-bpoint'

The gateway can be initialised by passing your login details like so:

``` ruby
gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::BpointGateway.new(:login => 'login', :password => 'pass', :merchant_number => 'num')
```

## Usage
Once you have an initialised gateway, there are several public methods available including `purchase`, `store` and `unstore`.

Here is an example of using the purchase method:

``` ruby
amount     = 1000 # 1000 cents is $10.00 AUD
options    = { :order_id => '5' } # Store the customers order number at the gateway

creditcard = ActiveMerchant::Billing::CreditCard.new(
      :number => '4111111111111111',
      :month => 8,
      :year => 2006,
      :first_name => 'Longbob',
    :last_name => 'Longsen'
)

response = gateway.purchase(amount, creditcard, options)

if response.sucess?
  puts "All OK!"
else
  puts response.message # Output the error message
end
```

## Contributing

Fork on GitHub and after youâ€™ve committed tested patches, send a pull request.

To get tests running simply `run bundle install` and then `rspec spec`.

The test suite performs some remote tests by hitting the gateway and uses the VCR gem which prerecords responses. This means that you do not need to enter any details to perform the remote tests. If you do need to add new actions which hit the gateway, or rerecord responses, simply add your point details to the `spec/test_credentials.rb` file.
